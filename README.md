# Algorithm-Visualizer
An application I made from scratch using Windows Forms, for visualizing pathfinding algorithms. 
Usage:
  Choose a Starting Tile by clicking the "Start Tile" button and selecting a tile.
  Choose a Goal Tile by clicking the "Goal Tile" button and selecting a tile.
  Clicking on a tile without the "Start Tile" or "Goal Tile" being pressed, creates a wall that blocks that tile from being part of the path.
  Holding 'X' and dragging the mouse over the tiles can create multiple walls.
  Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
  Pressing the "Start" button starts the algorithm.
  Pressing the "Reset" button resets all the tiles.
  
Currently the app can visualize Dijksta and A* algorithms, but Im planning to expand the list.
